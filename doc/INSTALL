                             INSTALLATION

0)
   Maybe paexec has been already packaged for your platform. See
   PACKAGES section in README file and your system package management
   tools.

1)
   You need bmake (portable version of NetBSD make) for building paexec.
   I'd recommend to use latest stable version.

   http://crufty.net/help/sjg/bmake.html

   NOTE:    !!! GNU make IS NOT GOOD !!!

2)
   We also need mk-configure >= 0.33.0.

   https://github.com/cheusov/mk-configure

     or

   http://sourceforge.net/projects/mk-configure/

3)
   "libmaa" library is also needed. It is a part of
   "dict" project available here:

   https://github.com/cheusov/libmaa

     or

   http://sourceforge.net/projects/dict/

4)
   If you want to change the default build options,
   run mkcmake like this

     env [YOUR_ASSIGNMENTS] mkcmake <target> [YOUR_ASSIGNMENTS]

   See example section below

5) Uncompress tarball you've downloaded like this
   gzip -dc paexec-X-Y-Z.tar.gz | tar -xf-

6) cd paexec-X-Y-Z

7) mkcmake

   In order to see additional information about settings and
   the structure of project you want to run

   mkcmake help
   
8) mkcmake test
   If this step fails on your system, please let me now.

9) mkcmake install

10) If you also want to install examples, run the following command

   mkcmake all-examples install-examples

   By default examples are installed
   to ${DATADIR}/doc/paexec/examples/.
   For changing it, set EGDIR environment variable.

11) If you also want to install README, NEWS, TODO etc., run the
    following command

   mkcmake all-doc install-doc

   By default these files are installed to ${PREFIX}/share/doc/.
   For changing it, set DOCDIR environment variable.

12) paexec project consists of the following subprojects:
     - paexec (paexec and paexec_reorder executables and appropriate
               manual pages)
     - doc (README, NEWS etc.)
     - examples (examples of use).
   By default only "paexec" is built and installed. You can build and
   install all "subprojects" like the following.

   env SUBPRJ_DFLT='paexec examples doc' mkcmake all install

13)
   paexec_reorder utility is written in runawk, so we need runawk>=1.4.3
   at runtime.

   http://sourceforge.net/projects/runawk/

14)
There is a lot of Makefile variables that can be changed during
build and installation.

  PREFIX         - where paexec and paexec_reorder are installed to
  MANDIR         - root directory for manual pages
  DESTDIR        - fake root for installation
  CPPFLAGS
  CFLAGS
  LDFLAGS
  LDADD
  ...

  NOTE: Environment variable must be the same at build and installation time!
  See mk-configure(7) for details.

------------------------------
Examples of build and installation:

 1)  export PREFIX=/usr SYSCONFDIR=/etc MANDIR=/usr/share/man
     export SUBPRJ_DFLT='paexec examples doc'
     mkcmake all
     env DESTDIR=/tmp/fake-root mkcmake install

 2)  env CC='icc' \
       PREFIX=/usr/pkg \
       CPPFLAGS='-I/usr/pkg/include' \
       LDFLAGS='-L/usr/pkg/lib -Wl,-rpath -Wl,/usr/pkg/lib' \
          mkcmake -s all install
